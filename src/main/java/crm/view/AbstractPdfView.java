 * Abstract PDF View for Cloud-Native Export

 * Cloud Readiness Improvements:
 * - Stateless design: No session state dependencies
 * - Request-scoped data only: All data passed via model
 * - No server affinity: Can run on any instance
 * - Horizontal scaling ready: No instance-specific state
 * - Memory efficient: Uses temporary byte array for PDF generation
 * 
 * This view generates PDF content directly from request-scoped model data
 * without relying on HTTP session state, making it compatible with
 * distributed session stores (Redis/Hazelcast) and cloud load balancers.
